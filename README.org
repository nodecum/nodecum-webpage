* nodecum Webpage

The Webpages are written by using emacs/go-org org mode
and the Hugo static website compiler.

* Org-Mode
When generating the documentation the org files are parsed by
[[https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org][go-org]] which is a part of Hugo. See [[https://niklasfasching.github.io/go-org][go-org doc]] for supported org features.

* Hugo
[[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]] is a static website generator. This means the source files
are converted to HTML files, which then represent the web pages. 

The used theme is [[https://github.com/frjo/hugo-theme-zen][Zen]].

** Installation
: snap install hugo --channel=extended
** Compile
To get a local web server which automatically updates to the last changed page:
: cd nodecum-webpage
: hugo server --navigateToChanged
after that you can point your webbrowser to the address [[http://localhost:1313]] to view
the web page. Every time you save an file in the directory ~content/~
this will cause a recompilation of the corresponding HTML file.
