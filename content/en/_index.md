The idea is to develop an independent, self-sufficient communication network
that is free to use. It is owned by the users, who purchase the devices,
called nodes in the following. The information is forwarded from node to
node by means of radio transmission. The range between the nodes is 5 km,
and up to 15 km in clear visibility. The nodes are powered by solar energy.
Thus, they can be positioned freely in the terrain and are independent of
the power grid. The personal nodes serve as a simple mailbox or web presence. The
user interacts with his personal node via Bluetooth/Wifi using his mobile
phone/computer or a special input/output device. The data throughput and
capacity of the nodes allows messages in text form. Search services are
provided through the nodes. The network grows in patches and organizes
itself. To enable accessibility or to increase throughput, individual
patches can be connected to each other via bridges using other technologies
(Internet, etc.).

'nodecum' means 'with (cum) node' and the logo symbolizes a receiving and
sending node: >o) ,the building block from which the network is created.
When it is turned, a person appears who receives and is connected.
